# Anvil
Anvil is a pytorch based library with the goal of being excellent for rapid prototyping of new algorithms and ideas over benchmarking. As such, this is **not** intended to provide template pre-built algorithms as a baseline, but rather flexible tools to allow the user to quickly build and test their own implementations and ideas.

## Developer Guide
1. Run `scripts/setup_dev.sh`
2. Relax and enjoy how easy that (hopefully) was ðŸ˜„

## Credit
Anvil was inspired by [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [Tonic](https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic)
