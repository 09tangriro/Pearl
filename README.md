# Anvil
Anvil is a pytorch based library with the goal of being excellent for rapid prototyping of new algorithms and ideas over benchmarking. We aim to provide tools not only for deep reinforcement learning but general reinforcement learning as well (e.g. evolutionary strategies, genetic algorithms etc.)

## Developer Guide
1. Run `scripts/setup_dev.sh`
2. Relax and enjoy how easy that (hopefully) was ðŸ˜„

## Credit
Anvil was inspired by [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [Tonic](https://github.com/fabiopardo/tonic)
