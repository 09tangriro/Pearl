Welcome to pearll's documentation!
===================================

`pearll <https://github.com/LondonNode/pearll>`_ (referred to as *Anvil*) is a pytorch based library with the goal of being excellent for rapid prototyping of new algorithms and ideas. As such, this is **not** intended to provide template pre-built algorithms as a baseline, but rather flexible tools to allow the user to quickly build and test their own implementations and ideas.
